# Combat Carbon Repository

Here is the link to our devpost: <a href = "https://devpost.com/software/carbon-competition">link</a>. You can find further information there. 

To test our app on the web, you can test it <a href = "https://boiling-beach-74341.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. If you want to use it locally, you should have node.js installed. Then, you can clone the repo and run
```
npm install
node server.js
```
in your directory to get the app running on port 3000 of your local host.
